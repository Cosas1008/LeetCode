#### Tree question

* Find Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree [Leetcode 671]
Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly `two` or `zero` sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.


#### practice Tree structure first

* Binary Tree

The tree node has data, left child and right child 
class Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};


#### basic file

* Binary Tree

1. int height()

==> find the height of binary tree;

2. int size()

==> return how many node in binary tree

3. void topView()

==> print the topView of that tree
