/*
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, 
while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:

Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.
