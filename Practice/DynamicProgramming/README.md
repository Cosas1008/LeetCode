### 44 Wildcard Matching

This can also solved by [greedy](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/discuss/17888/Simple-greedy-Python-with-regexes)

### 53 Maximum Subarray
Follow up 918 Max Sum Circular Subarray

### 85 & 221 Maximum Rectangle/Square

Worth a try

### House Robber



### 416. Partition Equal Subset

This technique using for loop from target to 0 is geneous

### 718 Max Length of Repeated Subarray

nums1 and nums2
