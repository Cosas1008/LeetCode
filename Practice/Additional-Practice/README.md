1. Decreasing Subsequences
```
Input: [5, 2, 4, 3, 1, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
You can split this array into: [5, 2, 1], [4, 3], [6]. And there are 3 subsequences you get.
Or you can split it into [5, 4, 3], [2, 1], [6]. Also 3 subsequences.
But [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [6] is not legal because [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] is not a subsuquence of the original array.

2. Max Distance
The distance between 2 binary strings is the sum of their lengths after removing the common prefix. For example: the common prefix of 1011000 and 1011110 is 1011 so the distance is len("000") + len("110") = 3 + 3 = 6.    
Given a list of binary strings, pick a pair that gives you maximum distance among all possible pair and return that distance.

3. 727 Min Window Subsequence
Given strings S and T
Input: 
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
Output: "bcde"
Explanation: 
"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.
