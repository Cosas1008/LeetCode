/*
Two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 are similar if it is possible to 
insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences 
such that the two sentences become equal. 
For example, 
    sentence1 = "Hello my name is Jane" 
and sentence2 = "Hello Jane" can be made equal by
    inserting "my name is" between "Hello" and "Jane" in sentence2.
