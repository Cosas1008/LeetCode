# Hash Table

1. 2 sum
2. 3 sum
3. 4 sum

Approaches
1. Brute-force

   Time Complexity : O(n^2)
   Space Complexity: O(1)

1. Hash table approach  
    This will establish the table first and search the table in second loop

   Time Complexity : O(n^2)
   Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Optimize hash table approach  
   We can simply use a single for-loop for establishing and searching throughout the building phase
